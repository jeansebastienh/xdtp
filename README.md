XdebugTraceParser
=================

XdebugTraceParser is a parsing tool for Xdebug function trace. It provides a way to analyse performance drawback in php application.

Installation
------------

XdebugTraceParser should be installed using the [PEAR Installer](http://pear.php.net/). This installer is the backbone of PEAR, which provides a distribution system for PHP packages, and is shipped with every release of PHP since version 4.3.0.

The PEAR channel (`pear.au-fil-du.net`) that is used to distribute XdebugTraceParser needs to be registered with the local PEAR environment.

    pear channel-discover pear.au-fil-du.net

This has to be done only once. Now the PEAR Installer can be used to install packages from the Au-Fil-du.net channel:

    pear install afdn/xdtp
